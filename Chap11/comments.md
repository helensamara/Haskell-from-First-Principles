## 11.3 Data and type constructors
- Be careful with the box/container analogy as it will betray
  you later — not all type arguments to constructors have
  value-level witnesses! Some are *phantom*.

## 11.5 Data constructors and values
- \4. HuskyData is the data constructor for HuskyType. Note that
  the type variable argument a does not occur as an argu-
  ment to HuskyData or anywhere else after the =. That means
  our type argument a is phantom, or, “has no witness.”
- data HuskyType a = HuskyData deriving Show
  HuskyData

## 11.6 What’s a type and what’s data?
- types are static and resolve at compile time.
- Data constructors are *usually* generated by the declaration.
  Usually??
