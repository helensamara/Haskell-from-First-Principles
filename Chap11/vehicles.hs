-- 1. What is the type of myCar?
-- Vehicle

-- 2. Given the following, define the functions:

isCar :: Vehicle -> Bool
isCar (Car _ _)   = True
isCar (Plane _ _) = False

isPlane :: Vehicle -> Bool
isPlane (Car _ _)   = False
isPlane (Plane _ _) = True

areCars :: [Vehicle] -> [Bool]
areCars = map isCar

-- 3. Now weâ€™re going to write a function to tell us
--    the manufacturer of a piece of data:

getManu :: Vehicle -> Manufacturer
getManu (Car x y) = x
getManu _         = error "Manufacturer not defined for planes."

-- >>> Test
getManu myCar
